## Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest versions of Python (this was built on Python 3.8), of OpenCV-Python, and of PySerial. 
* Any functioning OS that can run all of the above.
* An open-source 3D printer or misc. gantry system (for which you will need to adjust the values).
* A functioning, moderate quality color camera.
* You have read this guide.

## Execution:

1. Set up hardware as described in the paper. Obtain your hardware specifications e.g. baud rate. 
2. Run match_colors_get.py to obtain HSV values, adjusting input webcam or video for your setup. Test this with color_detection_test.py and adjust points as required.
3. Adjust color_stab.py for the vertical heights and horizontal widths of your gantry's dimensions. The video input and other specifications in setup should also be working, so you should test a sequence for your setup before putting live fish in.
4. Run color_stab.py with a stunned fish and kill the fish. Enjoy the high quality meat!
